#### Lesson 4
We covered modular arithmetics and RSA encryption, I made a small exercise for them.

#### Lesson 6
The topic was sequences and recursion, so a few lines of code calculated some sums.

#### Lesson 7
A bit of matrix multiplication and more about time complexity.

#### Lesson 8
Some recursion and Fibonacci numbers.

#### Assignments
I've added the descriptions for the assignments, they covered many topics
